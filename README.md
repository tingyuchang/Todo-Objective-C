# todo-ios
A simple todo app run in iOS

## Bugs

- Keyboard should show automatically on modal appear
- At add todo model, the keyboard return key should be 'Done'. Press it will 
  save the item.
- ToDo item should not finished on touch, make it finished by swipe
- A deleted item(by swipe) at finished tab re-appear on quit/reopen

## Tasks

1. Show me you can read code and produce good clean code
1. Fix the above bugs
1. ToDoListTableViewController and FinishedTableViewController are doing similar
   task, try to extract the common function and reduce code duplication. (okay
   to just think of direction within time, we can discuss it later)
1. Any refactoring you think will make the code better,
   reduce the chance to produce above bugs

## Constraint

- You are not allow to import external library
- Time limit is 1 hr

## Evalation

- We look for clean and maintainable code
- Attention to UI/UX
- How you fix the problem is more important than how fast you fix it
